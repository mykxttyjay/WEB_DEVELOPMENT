        <h1>Hi! I'm Park Jongseong</h1><br>
        <p>I'm a performer and artist passionate about music, fashion, and expressing creativity on stage. 
            <br>I love exploring different styles, improving my skills, and connecting with people through performances that tell a story. 
            <br>When I'm not practicing or performing, you can find me listening to music, studying fashion trends, cooking, 
            <br>or spending time discovering new inspirations that help me grow both as an artist and as a person.</p><br>
